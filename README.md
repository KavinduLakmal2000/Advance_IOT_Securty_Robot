# DEVELOPMENT AND OPTIMIZATION OF AN IOT SPIDER ROBOT FOR HOME AND INDUSTRIAL SECURITY WITH EMERGENCY RESPONSE

particularly built for boosting home 
security in Sri Lanka utilizing IoT technology. The robot contains six legs, enabling it 
to walk successfully on different interior surfaces, such as carpets and tiled floors, 
making it well-suited for Sri Lankan houses. It incorporates modern sensors to detect 
gas leaks, fires, or intruders, offering extra protection while homeowners are not there. 
When a possible danger is discovered, the robot delivers quick notifications to the 
ownerâ€™s mobile device via a linked application. This guarantees that homeowners are 
continually informed about the state of their property, allowing them to react swiftly 
to crises and boosting overall security. 
In addition to its main security responsibilities, the robot monitors variables, including 
temperature and humidity, as well as its own battery level. Where humidity and 
temperature variations may influence house safety. Furthermore, the system 
incorporates another external unit that may be connected into conventional power 
outlets. If the robot senses a fire, it sends a signal to this device, which may switch off 
the power supply to avoid additional damage and safeguard the property. 
In addition, a separate, balanced, and safe battery charging unit was designed to meet 
the robot's high-power demands. With the robot's 12 high-torque servomotors, the 
charging unit provides efficient, stable power while maintaining lightweight batteries, 
ensuring both long-term performance and safety during operation.
